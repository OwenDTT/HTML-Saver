# HTML-Saver
Firefox extension files for a html saver to send html to a specific server with a database and download it to your computer. 
NOTE: in extension.js you will have to put your own url with a mysql or mariadb database there. I will not provide one or the documentation to do so.
If you have any icon suggestions feel free to email at owendtt@owenwilliam.org.
To install in firefox follow these instructions.
1. Go to "about:debugging" in firefox without quotes
2. Head to "This Firefox" on the left side
3. Click "Temporary extensions"
4. Click "Load temporary add-on"
5. Once you unzip the zip file upload the manifest.json file and it should be installed
Email owendtt@owenwilliam.org for any questions or bug reports.
