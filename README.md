Firefox extension to send files to a database on a server and download it to your computer.
NOTE: in extension.js you will have to put your own url with a mysql or mariadb database there. I will not provide one or the documentation to setup a database.

1. Go to "about:debugging" in firefox without quotes
2. Head to "This Firefox" on the left side
3. Click "Temporary extensions"
4. Click "Load temporary add-on"
5. Once you unzip the zip file upload the manifest.json file and it should be installed.
