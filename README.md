# HTML-Saver
Firefox extension files for a html saver to send html to a specific server with a database and download it to your computer. 
NOTE: in extension.js you will have to put your own url with a mysql or mariadb database there. I will not provide one or the documentation to do so.
If you have any icon suggestions feel free to email at owendtt@owenwilliam.org.
